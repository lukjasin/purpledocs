# Introduction

**Welcome to the PurpleApp User and Administration Guide!**

This guide is designed to be your primary resource for understanding and effectively using the PurpleApp system. It covers the entire process, from preparing the necessary data and launching work activities, through performing various operations, to the crucial final steps of generating reports and managing financial data.

To make it easy to find the information you need, this documentation is divided into several key sections, each focusing on a distinct part of the system.  Within each section, you'll find detailed descriptions of individual screens and clear explanations of the most frequently performed actions.

Because user access is role-based, not all screens will be visible to every user.  Any screen or feature requiring specific access rights beyond the standard roles will be prominently highlighted at the beginning of its description.

**Home**: This section (which you are currently reading) provides general information about the documentation, including its structure and how to use it effectively.

**Web**: This section contains detailed descriptions of all screens available in the PurpleApp web application. It is written from the perspective of a standard web application user (with web access role).  It includes information on screen dependencies, data flow, input validations, typical workflows, installer monitoring, report generation, and the data management process for financial operations.

**Mobile**: This section provides a comprehensive overview of the PurpleApp mobile application, describing each screen and its functionalities.  Similar to the Web App section, any role-based access restrictions will be clearly marked.

**We hope that the following pages will help you get to know PurpleApp well.**
