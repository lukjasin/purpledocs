# Assets

## Overview
The **Assets** page is designed for managing devices that are installed or serviced in specific installations. It provides users with detailed insights into both registered devices awaiting installation and those already installed. Additionally, users can manage attached files such as photos, manuals, and other documentation, as well as track scheduled maintenance timelines.

Assets marked as installed in a given installation can be utilized on the **Building Plan** page and within the **Installation Details** view to define their exact position on the location's layout. This functionality significantly improves the ability to locate specific devices, especially in large-scale projects or locations with densely installed equipment.


_Building plans for specific location can be found in specific Installation details page. Look for Building Plan tab._

- Assets list screen
