## Working

The **Working** screen displays different data depending on whether the installer has already started work in a given installation or has not started work in it.


Until the installer selects an installation and starts working in it, the Working screen will display a list of installations assigned to it and the installations with the scheduled start date.

The listed installations can be expanded to display additional information and, depending on the distance, start navigation to a given location or start working there.

After starting work in a given installation, the Working screen switches to the mode of displaying information regarding only the selected installation.

## Schedule

The Schedule screen displays data of all installations for a given user divided into two groups:
- Assigned installations - installations assigned to a user on the Users or Installations page. Work on assigned installations can be started regardless of the date, the only condition is the presence of the installer in a given location.
- Scheduled installations - installations in which the work for the installer has been planned for a specific day. In such a case, the start of working time registration can only be started on a given date. This date is displayed on the right side of the record in the list, planned works in installations are sorted from the earliest planned to the latest.


_If the installer has not started recording working time, the Working and Schedule screens display the same data._
